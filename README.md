## What is Digital Transformation?

> Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. This reimagining of business in the digital age is digital transformation.
>
> It transcends traditional roles like sales, marketing, and customer service. Instead, digital transformation begins and ends with how you think about, and engage with, **customers**.  As we move from paper to spreadsheets to smart applications for managing our business, we have the chance to reimagine how we do business — **how we engage our customers** — with digital technology on our side. – https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/what-is-digital-transformation/
